<p>CyVerse Container Camp is an intense three-day hands-on workshop to learn how to create, use, and deploy containers across a variety of compute systems (your computer, local HPC, cloud compute environments, and national resources).  We will use blend of practical theory and hands-on exercises where small groups deploy tools and workflows they bring to the workshop. Outcomes: Theory and application of container technology, how to containerize an application, how to use other containerized applications, how to build/deploy containerized workflows and how to scale out your computation: From Laptop to Cloud to HPC. As part of this workshop, my role as one of the lead instructor is to teach the basic concepts of reproducible research using software containers<a href="https://www.cyverse.org/cc">here</a> </p>
