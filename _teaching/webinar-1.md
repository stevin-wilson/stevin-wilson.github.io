In this webinar, I presented WQ-MAKER, a customized version of MAKER with a Work Queue-based distributed computing framework designed to run MAKER on multiple virtual machines on the Jetstream cloud. We'll show how to run WQ-MAKER on a test dataset starting from setting up a Jetstream account along with some of the accessory scripts (Ansible playbooks and custom scripts) and a few apps developed to manage the computation and progress. Performance numbers for various genomes annotated using WQ-MAKER will be discussed. The tutorial for this webinar is online at: https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/TUT/MAKER+2.31.8+with+CCTOOLS+Jetstream+Tutorial and a publication describing WQ-MAKER is here: http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/research/papers/maker-wq-ijbra.pdf
