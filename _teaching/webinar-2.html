<p>In this webinar, I along with Andrew Nelson presented Evolinc, a two-part set of apps in the CyVerse Discovery Environment (DE). Evolinc-I is designed to make long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) identification easy and reproducible, regardless of the system. Evolinc-II compares such lncRNAs to determine whether they are conserved at the genomic or transcriptomic level in various species. This information is helpful in curating lncRNA populations and identifying promising candidates for functional analysis. The tutorial for running Evolinc can be found <a href="https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/DEapps/Evolinc+in+the+Discovery+Environment">here</a> and the paper describing the Evolinc can be found <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2017.00052/full">here</a></p>
