<p>Container technologies such as Docker and Singularity let scientists easily share, reuse, and scale all types of computational analyses. The CyVerse AstroContainers Workshop series are two-day hands-on workshops designed for astronomers to learn how to create, use, and deploy containers across a variety of compute systems (your computer, CyVerse, local HPC, etc). Our inaugural workshop will focus on Docker and Singularity. We will use a blend of practical theories and hands-on exercises for small groups to deploy tools and workflows they bring to the workshop. As part of this workshop, my role as one of the lead instructor is to teach the basic concepts of reproducible research using software containers <a href="https://astrocontainers.org/2018-05-workshop/">here</a> </p>
