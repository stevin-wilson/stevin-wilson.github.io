<p>This two-week workshop provided doctoral students and post-doctoral researchers with an overview of best data management practices, data science tools, and concrete steps and methods for performing end-to-end data intensive computing and data life-cycle management. Training will prepare participant to facilitate and promote reproducible science and data reuse. As part of this workshop, my role as one of the lead instructor is to teach the basic concepts of reproducible research using software containers. The tutorial for running Cybercarpentry workshop's containers can be found <a href="https://cyverse-cybercarpentry-container-workshop-2018.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/index.html">here</a> </p>
