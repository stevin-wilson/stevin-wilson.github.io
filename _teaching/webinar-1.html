<p>In this webinar, I presented WQ-MAKER, a customized version of MAKER with a Work Queue-based distributed computing framework designed to run MAKER on multiple virtual machines on the Jetstream cloud. We'll show how to run WQ-MAKER on a test dataset starting from setting up a Jetstream account along with some of the accessory scripts (Ansible playbooks and custom scripts) and a few apps developed to manage the computation and progress. Performance numbers for various genomes annotated using WQ-MAKER will be discussed. The tutorial for this webinar is online < a href="https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/TUT/MAKER+2.31.9+with+CCTOOLS+Jetstream+Tutorial">at</a> and a publication describing WQ-MAKER is here <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2792/31718b1bddb2a873a56b0f830980d7182872.pdf?_ga=2.22099506.829485247.1527016029-664105803.1525200947">here</a>.</p>
