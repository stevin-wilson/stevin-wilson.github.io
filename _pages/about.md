After completing my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Agriculture in India, I moved to UK to pursue my PhD in crop genetics from the University of Nottingham, UK where I established my foundations of molecular biology. The advent of next-generation DNA and RNA sequencing in the early 2010 have got me interested in the field of Bioinformatics and so I joined as a Postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Julin Maloof's [lab](http://malooflab.phytonetworks.org/) at the University of California, Davis where I developed genomic resources for *Brassica rapa* for understanding [shade avoidance response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shade_avoidance). Later on, to apply my computational and programming skills full-time, I joined [CyVerse](http://cyverse.org/) as a Science Analyst. At CyVerse I developed novel computational processes that let researchers integrate tools and algorithms into CyVerse’s computational infrastructure.

I have a deep background in Genomics and Bioinformatics with a specialization in applying predictive analytics across a varied set of biological problems. I am currently a Bioinformatics Data Scientist at [Greenlight Biosciences](https://www.greenlightbiosciences.com/) working on building machine learning models, data-driven insights and computational capabilities that will drive Greenlight's data-based value creation.

I am also a Data Science instructor at [Datacamp](https://learn.datacamp.com/) where built [BigData Fundamentals with PySpark](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/big-data-fundamentals-with-pyspark) and also worked as Technical Consultant for [Insight](http://insightdatascience.com/) Data Science fellowship program.
