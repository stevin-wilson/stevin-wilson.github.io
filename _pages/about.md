I completed my Batchelor's and Master's in Agriculture and Agricultural Biotechnology and my PhD in crop genetics from University of Nottingham, UK. I did my Post-doctoral studies at the University of California Davis and Oregon State University and I am currently working as Science Informatician at CyVerse, a life sciences cyberinfrastructure funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). At CyVerse, I scientifically interact with biologists, bioinformaticians, programming teams and other members of CyVerse team as well as coordinate development cross projects, and facilitate integration and cross-communication.
